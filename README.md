This project was done as part of machine learning course at uni. The task was to create the best regresion model for life expectancy predictions.

Models used:
- Own inplemetation of random forrest (used scikit-learn DecissionTreeRegresor class)
- Ridge regresion
- Decision tree

Data preprocessing was very limited as it was not main subject of this course.

Models were trained and tested on one dataset that was supplied with predicted variable. Best model was used to make predictions on another dataset without *life expectancy* values. The predictions were one clasification parameters of this assignement.
